## Clarify TODO Tasks

For each todo task, ask a single, specific question if you need any clarification. This ensures that you fully understand the intent and scope of each task.

## Implement TODO Tasks:

Implement TODO tasks from top to bottom one by one. Check if you should continue after completing each task.

## Update Task Status:

Tick the checkbox after you complete one task, for example, after you complete task1, tick task1 checkbox like this:

- [x] <task1>
- [ ] <task2>
